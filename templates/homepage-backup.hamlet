          Error pages are not what typically appear on your screen when you're surfing
          the web, but when it happens it's so annoying! To see how servers work from
          within, we will build a simple web server by ourselves. We will use Node.js as
          a server part technology for that task. Then we'll use Heroku cloud application
          platform to turn this local server into a world wide server.
